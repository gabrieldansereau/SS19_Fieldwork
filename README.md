### Project subjet :
Our project's aim is to know how far do ecologists live from their fieldroject.
We used the website DataOne and the R packages "rdataone","xml", and "tidyverse".
By using the rdataone R package, we used specific keywords to target the interested subject in the ecology field. Afterward, we downloaded the metadata in .xml format. Next, we used the tidyverse package to organise the .xml metadata and to substract the project subject parameters then transform into data frame and .csv format.
