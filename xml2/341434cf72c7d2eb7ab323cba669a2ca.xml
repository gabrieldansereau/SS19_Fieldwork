This is the "large environmental database" of our FLRACEP project. These environmental data are not time series, but rather "climatologies" that depict long-term, average environmental conditions in the Gulf of Mexico. Some of these environmental data are for the entire Gulf of Mexico Large Marine Ecosystem, while others are only for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico only. We requested raw environmental data collected in the Gulf of Mexico between 2000 and the present, which we processed to generate the "large environmental database" provided here.]]></gco:CharacterString>

(2) “Bottom_DO_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC DO data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, DO data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs. Note that NODC DO data are available for the different months of the year. However, in some months, these data are so limited that it is not reasonable to use them.

(3) “Bottom_nitrate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of nitrate concentration at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC nitrate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, nitrate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs. 

(4) “Bottom_phosphate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of phosphate concentration at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC phosphate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, phosphate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.

(5) “Bottom_salinity.csv”: For each month and season, measurements of salinity at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete. Therefore, bottom salinity data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.

(6) “Bottom_silicate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of silicate concentration at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC silicate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, silicate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs. 

(7) “Bottom_temperature.csv”: For each month and season, measurements of temperature at the maximum depth for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete. Therefore, bottom temperature data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.

(8) “Distance_from_coastal_rivers.csv”: We downloaded inland water shapefiles for the U.S., Mexico and Cuba from http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata, from which we retrieved the geographic coordinates of the mouth of coastal rivers of the Gulf of Mexico. Then, we estimated the distance from coastal rivers for each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico with MATLAB.

(9) “Distance_from_shore.csv”: Distance from shore was estimated for the whole Gulf of Mexico in MATLAB, using a dedicated function ("dist_from_coast").

(10) “Distance_to_estuaries_and_lagoons.csv”: The geographic coordinates of the estuaries and lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico were retrieved from GulfBase (http://www.gulfbase.org/), from which the distance to estuaries and lagoons was estimated for each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico with MATLAB.

(11) “Dominant_sediment_type.csv”: The best available data on sediment type, dSEABED2006, does not provide complete coverage for the entire Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, dSEABED2006 data have a low resolution. Therefore, a nearest neighbor function was executed on a 0.008◦ grid using the natural neighbor function in MATLAB in order to provide a continuous surface. Then, it was possible to determine the dominant sediment type in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico. 

(12) “Local_percentage_of_gravel.csv”: The best available data on sediment type, dSEABED2006, does not provide complete coverage for the entire Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, dSEABED2006 data have a low resolution. Therefore, a nearest neighbor function was executed on a 0.008◦ grid using the natural neighbor function in MATLAB in order to provide a continuous surface. Then, it was possible to compute the percentage of gravel in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

(13) “Local_percentage_of_hardbottom.csv”: Firstly, we estimated the presence (or absence) of rock in each cell of a 0.008◦ grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico. The best available data on sediment type, dSEABED2006, does not provide complete coverage for the entire Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, dSEABED2006 data have a low resolution. Therefore, a nearest neighbor function was executed on a 0.008◦ grid using the natural neighbor function in MATLAB in order to provide a continuous surface. Secondly, we estimated the presence (or absence) of natural reefs in each cell of a 0.008◦ grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico. The geographic coordinates of the shallow water reefs of the GOM were retrieved from ReefBase (http://www.reefbase.org/), while the geographic coordinates of the deep sea corals of the Gulf of Mexico were retrieved from NOAA Deep Sea Coral Data Portal (https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov/). From these data, it was possible to determine the presence (or absence) of natural reefs in each cell of a 0.008◦ grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico. Finally, from the data of presence/absence of rock and the data of presence/absence of natural reefs for the 0.008◦ grid, it was possible to compute the percentage of hardbottom in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

Then, it was possible to compute the percentage of sand in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

(18) “Number_of_oil_and_gas_platforms.csv”: The location of the current oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico was obtained from https://www.data.boem.gov/homepg/data_center/mapping/geographic_mapping.asp, from which we estimated the number of oil and gas platforms in the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

(19) “Number_of_ports_marinas_and_peers.csv”: Regarding marinas and peers, we downloaded the geographic coordinates of the marinas and peers of the Gulf of Mexico available in the Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas, from which we estimated the number of marinas and peers in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Regarding ports, we retrieved the geographic coordinates of the ports of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from the World Port Index. The data in this publication is mostly tabular and new editions are published bi-annually and is available as a download from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency website (http://164.214.12.145/pubs/pubs_j_wpi_sections.html).

(20) “Number_of_rivers.csv”: We downloaded inland water shapefiles for the U.S., Mexico and Cuba from http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata, from which we estimated the number of rivers in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

(21) “Number_of_waterways.csv”: We downloaded waterway network shapefiles for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from http://corpsmapu.usace.army.mil/cm_apex/cm2.cm2.map. From all these shapefiles, except those for sealanes and intracoastal waterways, we estimated the number of waterways in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico. 

(22) “Oceanic_current_speed.csv”: OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time) third degree resolution ocean surface current data for the period 2005-2015 were downloaded from http://www.esr.org/oscar_index.html, from which we estimated oceanic current speed in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico for the different months and seasons of the year.

(23) “Precipitation.csv”: PERSIANN-CDR 0.25° resolution daily precipitation data for the period 2000-2015 were downloaded from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdr/atmospheric/precipitation-persiann-cdr, from which we estimated precipitation in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico for the different months and seasons of the year.

(24) “Presence_of_artificial_reefs.csv”: We downloaded the geographic coordinates of the artificial reefs of the Gulf of Mexico from http://marinecadastre.gov/data/, from which we determined the presence (or absence) of artificial reefs in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.

(25) “Presence_of_estuaries_and_lagoons.csv”: The geographic coordinates of the estuaries and lagoons of the Gulf of Mexico were retrieved from GulfBase (http://www.gulfbase.org/), from which the presence (or absence) of estuaries and lagoons in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico was determined.

(26) “Presence_of_mangrove.csv”: A shapefile providing the distribution of mangrove in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in the 2000s was downloaded from https://gcplcc.databasin.org/datasets/6ec804f5250a483abd9bdb200939247f, from which the presence (or absence) of mangrove in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico was determined. 

(27) “Presence_of_oyster_beds.csv”: The geographic coordinates of oyster beds of the Gulf of Mexico were downloaded from the Gulf of Mexico Data Atlas, from which the presence (or absence) of oyster beds in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico was determined.

(28) “Presence_of_sargassum_hotspots.csv”: Hardy (2014) determined sargassum hotspots in the northern Gulf of Mexico from May to August using Landsat satellite data. From Hardy (2014)'s estimates, we determined the presence (or absence) of sargassum hotspots in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico for the months of May, June, July and August. It is reasonable to assume that sargassum hotspots for the period of September to April are the sargasum hotspots for the period from May to August that are located west of the Mississippi River Delta (Robert F. Hardy, Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, St. Petersburg, personal communication).

(29) “Presence_of_seagrass.csv”: Shapefiles for Mexico, Cuba and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico states were obtained, from which the presence (or absence) of seagrass in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico was determined. Data for Florida were provided by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and were compiled from datasets that varied in age from as early as 1987 to as recent as 2009. Data in Alabama, produced in 2009 and not included in data from other states, were provided by the Mobile Bay National Estuary Program. The dataset includes several species of submerged aquatic vegetation not classified as true seagrasses in the lower salinity zones of northern Mobile Bay. Data for Mississippi and Louisiana were obtained from a 2004 online dataset provided by the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center. Data for Texas waters were provided by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and were compiled from data spanning various dates from 1988 through 2007. The Texas dataset excludes widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima), which is included in data from the other states. Notes for Florida source data: This polygon GIS data set represents a compilation of statewide seagrass data from various source agencies and scales. The data were mapped from sources ranging in date from 1987 to 2009. Not all data in this compilation are mapped from photography; some are the results of field measurements. The original source data sets were not all classified in the same manner; some used the Florida Land Use Cover and Forms Classification System (FLUCCS) codes 9113 for discontinuous seagrass and 9116 for continuous seagrass; some defined only presence and absence of seagrass, and some defined varying degrees of seagrass percent cover. In order to merge all of these data sources into one compilation data set, FWRI reclassified the various source data attribute schemes into two categories: "Continuous Seagrass" and "Patchy (Discontinuous) Seagrass". In areas where studies overlap, the most recent study where a given area has been interpreted is represented in this data set. This data set is not comparable to previous statewide data sets for time series studies - not all areas have been updated since the previous statewide compilation and some areas previously not mapped are now included. Please contact GIS Librarian to request the source data if you need to do a time series comparison. This data set has been updated in several areas from the previous compilation, including Northern Miami-Dade (2009), Biscayne Bay (2005), Dry Tortugas (2006), and Parts of Rookery Bay NERR (2003-2006). Data for Cuba and Mexico are more generalized, representing broad areas of seagrass occurrence as opposed to delineated beds. Mexico and Cuba seagrass areas are provided by the global compilation of seagrasses produced in 2005 by the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Center.

(33) “Presence_of_wetlands.csv”: A wetland shapefile was downloaded from http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/atlasftp.html?openChapters=chpwater#chpwater, from which the presence (or absence) of wetlands in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico was determined.
                                                                                                                            
(34) “Presence_of_wrecks.csv”: The Office of Coast Survey’s Wrecks and Obstructions database contains information on the identified submerged wrecks within the U.S. maritime boundaries. Information for the database is sourced from the NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC) and Automated Wrecks and Obstructions Information System (AWOIS). We downloaded the Office of Coast Survey’s Wrecks and Obstructions database from http://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/hsd/wrecks_and_obstructions.html. From these data, we determined the presence (or absence) of wrecks in each cell of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico.
                                                                                                                            
(35) “Probability_of_encounter_of_algae.csv”: We produced a probability of encounter map for algae for the Gulf of Mexico, using a binomial generalized additive model fitted to the comprehensive survey database compiled for the FLRACEP project; this binomial generalized additive model predicts probability of encounter as a function of long-term mean annual bottom temperature, long-term mean annual surface chlorophyll-a concentration, year, and the confounding factor of "gear" (survey).
                                                                                                                            
(36) “Probability_of_encounter_of_jellyfish.csv”: We produced a probability of encounter map for jellyfish for the northern Gulf of Mexico, using a binomial generalized linear mixed model fitted to the comprehensive survey database compiled for the FLRACEP project.
                                                                                                                            
(37) “Probability_of_storm_occurrence.csv”: The relative probability of storm occurrence in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated from the densities of tropical cyclone tracks in the Gulf of Mexico provided in Knapp et al. (2010). This database was derived from data provided by many Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers, other international centers, and individuals to create a global best-track dataset, followed by merging storm information from multiple centers into one product and archiving the data for public use. To construct the track density dataset used on this map, the Environmental Systems Research Institute Line Density tool was used with a neighborhood radius of 50 kilometers (31 miles) to calculate the number of tracks around each 10-square-kilometer (3.8-square-mile) cell that collectively comprises the entire Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean within the map extent. Estimates of relative probability of storm occurrence were obtained by dividing estimates of density of tropical cyclone tracks by their maximum value in the Gulf of Mexico.

(41) “Surface_DO_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) at the surface for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC DO data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, DO data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs. Note that NODC DO data are available for the different months of the year. However, in some months, these data are so limited that it is not reasonable to use them.
                                                                                                                            
(42) “Surface_nitrate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of nitrate concentration at the surface for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC nitrate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, nitrate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.
                                                                                                                            
(43) “Surface_phosphate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of phosphate concentration at the surface for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC phosphate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, phosphate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.
                                                                                                                            
(44) “Surface_salinity.csv”: For each month and season, measurements of salinity at the surface for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) regional climatology database. These measurements are incomplete. Therefore, surface salinity data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.
                                                                                                                            
(45) “Surface_silicate_concentration.csv”: For each season, measurements of silicate concentration at the surface for each grid point can be extracted from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC). These measurements are incomplete; also, the NODC silicate concentration data has a low resolution (1.0◦). Therefore, silicate concentration data were subjected to spline interpolation on a 0.18◦C grid using ArcGIS 10.4, so as to provide a continuous surface from which to fit generalized additive models (GAMs) and make predictions with these GAMs.
                                                                                                                            
(46) “Terrain_Ruggedness_Index.csv”: We accessed the SRTM30 PLUS global bathymetry grid from the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Observing System (http://gcoos.tamu.edu/). From these bathymetry data, we estimated Riley et al. (1999)'s Terrain Ruggedness Index in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico in R, using a dedicated function (the "tri" function from the R package "spatialEco").
                                                                                                                            
(47) “Turbidity.csv”: Ocean color K490 (the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm) is directly related to the presence of organic or inorganic particles in the water and constitutes an indication of water turbidity. K490 expresses how deeply visible light penetrates in the ocean and its value describes the extent to which the intensity of visible light (with wavelength equal to 490 nm) is reduced as it penetrates into the ocean. Higher K490 value mean smaller attenuation depth, and lower clarity of ocean water. Monthly Composites of ocean color K490 produced from MODIS AQUA data for the period 2002-2012 were downloaded from http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/, from which we estimated ocean color K490 in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico for the different months and seasons of the year.
                                                                                                                            
(48) “Wind_speed.csv”: NOAA/NCDC blended monthly 0.25-degree sea surface wind composites for the period 2000-2011 were downloaded from http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/, from which we estimated wind speed in each of the cells of a 0.18° grid covering the entire Gulf of Mexico for the different seasons of the year.||||]]></gco:CharacterString>
