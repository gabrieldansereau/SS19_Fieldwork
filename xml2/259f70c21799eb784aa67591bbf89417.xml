This is based on previous work demonstrating that bull kelp biomass can be predicted by sub-bulb diameter (Stekoll et al. 2006). These data were collected in conjunction with drone imagery to ground-truth biomass estimates obtained from Landsat satellite imagery. For each sampled plant, date, GPS location of the bed, stipe length and weight, blade length and weight, bulb and sub-bulb diameter, and level of erosion were recorded. These data were collected as part of a larger, interdisciplinary project (Apex Predators, Ecosystems, and Community Sustainability or APECS; http://apecs-ak.org/) aimed to assess the impacts of sea otter recolonization on the natural and human ecosystems of Prince of Wales Island, Southeast Alaska. Other datasets related to APECS are archived with KNB.</para></abstract><keywordSet><keyword>Nereocystis</keyword><keyword>Kelp</keyword><keyword>Canopy</keyword><keyword>Biomass</keyword><keyword>Alaska</keyword><keywordThesaurus>None</keywordThesaurus></keywordSet><intellectualRights><para>This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

Only beds that were &#x3E; 30 m in diameter (the size of one Landsat pixel) were sampled. One GPS location was recorded for each bed. Plants sampled within each bed were randomly selected and harvested by hand from a vessel. For each plant, stipe length was measured to the nearest centimeter. For most plants, the entire stipe was not harvested. Thus, stipe length was defined as the straight-line distance from the top of the bulb to either the holdfast or the end of the stipe portion that was harvested. Blade length was measured from the top of the bulb to the end of the longest blade. Bulb diameter was measured at the widest outside point of the bulb to the nearest 0.1 cm. Sub-bulb diameter was measured as stipe diameter at the base of the bulb to the nearest 0.1 cm. Fresh blade and stipe weight were measured separately with a hanging scale to the nearest 0.1 kg. Level of plant erosion was qualitatively scored as none, light, moderate, or heavy based on the number of missing blades, wear and degradation on the blades, and presence of epibionts and/or epiphytes.</para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para>Sites were located off the western coast of Prince of Wales Island, AK (coordinates are included in the data file).
