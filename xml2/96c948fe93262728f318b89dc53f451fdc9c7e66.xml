    <abstract>
      <para>From June 2010 until February 2011, fifty streams were surveyed to determine the physical characteristics of streams in forested, traditional land use, and developed settings.  Cross-sectional measurements were taken at 16 cross-sections on each reach.  The distance between each cross-section was twice the average active channel width (which was determined prior to the survey). At one to three locations within each surveyed reach, slope was determined by placing a laser level at a location upstream and then measuring the amount of elevation change at the water surface. Between each cross-section, the instream habitat was recorded. Large woody debris was measured where it was found within the surveyed reach of the stream.  Only LWD with diameter &gt;10 cm was measured. At a representative riffle within the reach, a Wolman pebble count (100 randomly selected pieces of sediment) was taken.</para>

      <abstract>
        <para>Multi-scale process-oriented research is proposed on the consequences to the southernAppalachian socio-ecological system of the interaction between changing climate and landuse. Landscapes in the southeastern U.S. are expected to change profoundly in the next fivedecades as the socioeconomic factors driving the dramatic exurbanization of the past threedecades persist, and the changes to the rates, frequencies, and intensities of importantclimatic factors occur. Climate and land use change will especially impact the rural andquasi-rural lands that still characterize much of southern Appalachia where this research iscentered.The proposed research will extend long-term measurements, field experiments andinterdisciplinary modeling from small watershed studies to regional-scale analyses so as toaccount for increases in resource demand and competition from adjacent and more distantareas. The research focus will be on the provisioning service of water quantity, the regulatingservice of water quality, and the supporting service of maintaining biodiversity. Theoverarching question that guides this research is: How will key ecosystem processes and thefocal ecosystem services of water quantity, water quality, and biodiversity be impacted bythe: (1) transition in land uses from wildland to urban and peri-urban; (2) changes in climate;and (3) interactions between changes in land use and climate including both on-site and off-site feedbacks?</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>

          <description>
            <para>Quality control analysis was performed using the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB software. Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.</para>
