 <abstract> <para>This research program was conducted to quantify how increasing understory ï¬res alter forest features and the patterns of tree mortality. Data collected include floristic survey with measurement of diameter at breast height (dbh),bark thickness, fire scars, etc. Forest features include Leaf Area Index (LAI), litterfall and Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), temperature, relative humidity and precipitation throughout the year. Some features directly related to the fire was VPD during the fire and char heigth (proxy  of fire intensity) .</para>

 <methods> <methodStep> <description> <section> <title>Fire-induced tree mortality</title>
 <para>Tree mortality and forest features was measured in three 50-ha treatment  plots (0.5Ã1.0 km), which include a unburned control (A), a plot burned every three years (B), and a plot burned annually (C). Experimental burns were conducted in either August or September, near the end of the dry season, when many escaped wild ï¬res typically occur</para>

 <instrumentation>Trees were sampled according three diameter classes: from 10 to 20 cm in diameter, from 20 to 40 cm and above 40 cm in diameter. Each class was sampled with different sampling effort. In the first diameter class we surveyed an area with only 1.22ha, in second diameter class the surveyed an area of 4.97ha and in the third class the surveyed area was 50 ha (the entire area).</instrumentation>
