<abstract>
<para>This dataset contains understory aboveground biomass data from a destructive harvest performed in 2009 at the Alaskan peatland experiment. Two peatland types are included, a bog site and a fen site. Within the fen site a water table manipulation has been ongiong since 2005, with control, lowered and raised water table treatment plots. Samples at the  bog were collected in a plot established within the lowland black spruce permafrost plateau (permafrost), and two plots established within collapse scars embedded within the plateau. One collapse scar formed ~ 45 years ago (old collapse) and the other formed ~ 25 years ago based upon aerial photography provided by the BCEF LTER.  The data provided in this data set can be sorted by site and plot.</para>

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<para>The bog site contains 3 plots, one in an area of stable permafrost (Permafrost plot), one in a thermokarst collapse scar ~45 years old and another collapse scar ~ 25 years old. At the fen site there are three water table manipulation plots ( control, lowered, and raised) with 3 open top chambers nested within each plot (data from OTCs was not collected, unless otherwise noted).</para>

<title>Methods</title>
<para>FIELD:   Biomass samples were collected concurrently with point frame quadrats in 100 cm2 subplots, collected at random along three transects every 2-3 meters within a given plot, or immediately adjacent to a point frame quadrat (placed randomly within each plot).  All aboveground understory biomass included within the area of the subplot was harvested for a sample, with the moss layer removed to the base of living moss in the peat surface layer. Samples were collected at peak biomass within a collection period of seven days between all plots at both sites. At the bog 24 samples were collected in the permafrost and old collapse plots and 26 samples were collected in the new collapse. At the fen 14 samples were collected in and around the control treatment plot and three samples were collected in each of the lowered and raised water table treatments.     LAB:  All biomass samples were initially separated into individual vascular plant species, moss functional groups, litter or woody debris. Vascular plant specimens were further subdivided into year of growth (new, living or dead). Living tissue referred to material that had not grown this previous summer, but was alive and functioning as part of the organism. Dead material that could be identified to the species level that was no longer living was designated as the functional group standing dead, while litter was the category reserved for remaining unknown dead material (Shaver and Chapin, 1991).</para>
