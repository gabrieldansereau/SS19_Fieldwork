 <abstract> <para>General description:
This data is a common neighbourhood plant removal experiment.  In this instance, the same experiment was repeated at 11 mountain locations globally and at each site, repeated at &apos;low&apos; and &apos;high&apos; sites.  We established removal experiments at the beginning of growing seasons from 1996 through 1999.  Plants were harvested at the end of the following (second) growing season with the exception of the Cairngorms and the Banff locations where the experiment lasted only one growing season.  Elevation used was selected based on the following criteria: lowest elevation possible that was alpine meadow with few shrubs, and highest was alpine meadow vegetation present but at highest possible elevation with meadow vegetation cover or structure still present.

Variables:
Location: Mountain range descriptor.

Site: Either low or high elevation.

Species: Depending on the individual research manager for each location, either the actual species name is reported or a code. At each site 310 target species were chosen.  We chose target individuals that were small relative to nearby conspecifics, and for which relatively distinct individuals or ramets could be found.  Some of the target species were clonal, and to reduce the effect of clonality individuals within 10 cm of a conspecific were not used as targets.

Treatment: All vegetation was removed around target individual plants in treated groups (T) while vegetation was left intact in control individuals (C).  10cm area was the definition used for neighbourhood.

Rep: Replicate # assigned simply for tracking purposes.

Target mass: The final biomass of target individuals at the end of two growing season.  Dry weight is reported in grams.  Absence of a value is either missing or dead but not coded in this instance.  All aboveground parts were included in the mass after oven drying for 3 days at 70C.

 <para>We chose two experimental sites at each of 11 different locations around the world. At each location one site was placed in subalpine herbaceous vegetation and the other was placed from 300m (Cairngorms) to 1,200m (Andes) higher in alpine
vegetation. This allowed us to explore interaction strengths and directions along one of the
complex abiotic gradients, elevation, thought to be the most important for alpine
communities. We adopted Grimes perspective that productivity and biomass are correlated with stress. The gradient from subalpinemeadow to alpine tundra is correlated with large decreases in productivity and biomass because of lower temperatures and
shorter growing seasons and at all 11 locations in our study vegetation cover, biomass, and height were noticeably lower at the high sites than at the low sites.

Interactions among plants were assessed by the removal of all neighbouring species within 10 cm of a target individual, and comparison of the performance of target plants with neighbours removed to that of control target plants around which neighbours were left intact. At each site 310 target species were chosen. We chose target individuals that were small relative to nearby conspecifics, and for which relatively distinct individuals or ramets could be found.</para>
