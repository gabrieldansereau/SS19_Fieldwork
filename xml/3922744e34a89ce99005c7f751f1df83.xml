&lt;p&gt;The H.J.Andrews Experimental Forest comprises the Lookout Creek Basin (6500 ha).  Lookout Creek as well as nine smaller watersheds within the basin  have gaging stations.  The nine sites consist of three sets of paired watershed experiments: WS 1, 2, 3; WS 6, 7, 8; WS 9, 10; and Mack Creek, a larger (600 ha), old-growth watershed.  Drainage areas for the paired watersheds range from 9 to 100 ha and elevations range from 460 to 960 m.  Watersheds 2, 8, and 9 are forested controls.&lt;/p&gt;

There are 20 proportions equal to discharge increases of 1/20th of the expected maximum discharge. For each proportional increase, the number of samples taken in the base time period increases by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples are taken by a battery powered, in-house constructed sampler designed by Richard Fredriksen, study originator. Samples are collected in 5 gal. polyethylene carboys stored in a insulated housing or cabinet. Streamflow is measured continuously with Leopold-Stevens A-35 recorders and Stevens PAT with Campbell CR-10 data logger. The interface between the sampler and the recorders is an array of magnetic reed switches which are activated by magnets attached to the counter weights of the recorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Composite samples, taken over periods ranging from 1 to 3 weeks, contain representative sampling of the sediment and dissolved constituents carried by the stream over the collection period Before 1988, samples were collected from the field every three weeks and returned to Corvallis for analysis. During high flow periods the samples were collected at shorter intervals to prevent the carboys from overflowing. Since 1988, stream proportional samples are collected weekly and refrigerated at the Andrews until samples are brought to Corvallis for analysis (every 3 weeks).  The individual weekly samples are combined and analyzed as a composite 3-week sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples are typically combined at the Andrews, but partial samples and other very large samples may be combined proportionally at the lab. All samples are assigned sample type codes. The rules for combining samples and assigning sample type codes were reviewed and are restated as of 10/28/96 by CCAL lab chemist, Cam Jones, as follows: &lt;br&gt;
All three weekly proportional samples for a given watershed sampler, whether partial or full, should be combined for the 3-week period. Any partial collection will cause the sample type designation to be partial (&quot;P&quot;) for that entire three week period. Grab samples should be taken when no sample has been collected through the proportional sampler for any single week. Grab samples should be combined with other grab samples and submitted separately to the lab - a carboy could contain one, two or three weekly grab samples. A carboy with three grab samples should be designated as a grab (&quot;G&quot;) sample type. Proportional samples with less than 2 liters of water will be augmented AT THE LAB with any grab sample that has been submitted separately and designated as augmented (&quot;A&quot;) sample type. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dates in the data file refer to the end date of a collection period. Data is summarized by water year: October 1 to September 30. Sample type codes note any sample abnormalities resulting from sampler malfunctions or other problems: 1) &quot;P&quot; for partial or incomplete sample, 2) &quot;G&quot; for grab sample taken when sampler inoperative, and 3) &quot;A&quot; for augmented sample when water volume is inadequate, 4) &quot;Y&quot; represents an end-of-year value that is based on the overall concentration of the sampling period, but is not an actual sample. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Quality control samples are taken biannually (one in the winter and one in the summer) at one site each year. Grab samples are taken above and below the station, and two samples are taken through the sampler. One of the through-sampler samples is left at the station and collected with the composite sample the following week. The other through-sampler sample and the grab samples are refrigerated at the Andrews until the composite samples are brought to Corvallis for analysis. Quality control samples undergo the same analysis as the composite samples.&lt;/p&gt;</para></section></description><instrumentation>1)Battery powered proportional stream water sampler

Note: Diss. Total N values from 6/1/1970-6/21/1971 do not include free ammonia (NH4-N)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Official compilation of water analyses begins with the WY 1969 (10/1/68). The first year, water was stored at 0 degrees C until operation of the PNW-1653 lab in spring, 1969. Originally, samples are analyzed for suspended sediment, alkalinity, pH, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, dissolved organic nitrogen, ortho and total phosphorus, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and silica.  Sulfate was determined for WY 1972 and sulfate and chloride in WY 1979.  Aluminum, iron, manganese, and nitrite were below levels of detection and were subsequently dropped from analysis. Analysis of specific conductivity was added in Dec 1974 and total P on an unfiltered sample in Oct 1974.  Analysis of total N on an unfiltered sample was started in June 1978.  In general, duplicates were run on all analyses until Oct 1983, and are currently conducted randomly.  Sulphur and Chloride were  analyzed at the University of Washington until 2004, and are now conducted at Oregon State.  Dissolved organic carbon was initiated in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, all samples are filtered upon arrival at the Corvallis lab and pH, alkalinity, conductivity, and autoanalyzer runs (NO3-N, NH4-N, SI) are made immediately.  All analyses are completed within 6 weeks.  Generally, samples are stored at 0 degrees C if not analyzed immediately. &lt;/p&gt;</para></section></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><section><title>Processing Procedures - CF002</title><para>&lt;p&gt;A Visual Foxpro program (pio_fox) combines nutrient concentration data with streamflow to produce outputs in kilogram per hectare by water year, and creates annual nutrient concentrations.
